From Solidity, Blockchain, and Smart Contract Course - Beginner to Expert Python Tutorial freeCodeCamp.org

At the end of May 2023 I got interested in Blockchain Development and thought I'd take a look.

Wow!  It's like 1995 again and I'm diving back in!  This is my first repository!

This is a great tutorial that you can find on YouTube youtube.com/watch?v=M576WGiDBdQ

Have fun!
